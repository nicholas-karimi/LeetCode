## Intro
This repo [LeetCoding](https://github.com/nicholas-karimi/LeetCode),  documens common coding interview problem and solution solved in both `go lang` and `python` programming languages.

The folders `go` and `python` contains similar solution implementation specific to the language.

I'll also include _company_ specific problems and solutions that I have interviewed for in the past in my pursuit of software related jobs.

The ultimate goal is to improve my **Data Structures & Algorithm** skills to a mastery level. Additionally, I also plan to teach this in a year from now either via a `blog` post or `youtube`. I know I can, this is my `trusted conviction` so walk with me!

### References
While solving these problems, I will be following a well curated `roadmap` by [Neet Code Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). This is an extensive, clickable roadmap with over `150` common programming challenges.
